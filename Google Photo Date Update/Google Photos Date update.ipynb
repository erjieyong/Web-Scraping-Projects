On the other hand, whenever we factory reset our phone or change a new phone, whatsapp will download all the backup images and videos onto the new phone again, albeit with the downloaded date and time.\n",

Google photos will upload all these images and videos and update it as the downloaded date although the actual photo shared date can be glean from the images and video file name.\n",

    "- As of 1 January 2021, google photos was not turn on to automatically back up whatsapp images\n",

    "- Image was backed up by whatsapp to a cloud storage\n",
